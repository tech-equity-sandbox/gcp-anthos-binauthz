# Tech Equity Sandbox Guide

Follow the steps below to get started.

**Step 1**

Type `ls` to view the script. 

Type a command similar to `./gcp-anthos-azure.sh` to run the script where gcp-anthos-azure.sh is the script name in this scenario.

**Step 2**

Select options from the menu to view the commands.

**Step 3**

To execute the commands, select option M and follow the instructions to login and select a Google Cloud project. We recommend using a different project for each lab. 

**Don't forget to clean up after yourself**: Delete the project to avoid unnecessary charges. Use `gcloud projects delete <PROJECT-ID>`.
