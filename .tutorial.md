# Tech Equity Sandbox Guide

This asset is from a collection used to accelerate Google Cloud adoption in enterprise engagements. 

It enables professionals to experience the cloud with minimal investment in time and effort. 

The labs experiences are fully automated and require minimal manual intervention.

Follow the steps below to get started.

**Step 1**

Login to the Google Cloud platform and create a project for the lab. We recommend using a different project for each lab. Delete the project on completion to avoid charges.

**Step 2**

Run the script in the cloud shell terminal root directory. 

Type `ls` to view the script. 

Type a command similar to `./gcp-anthos-azure.sh` to run the gcp-anthos-azure.sh script.

**Step 3**

Authenticate at the prompt with the Google Cloud email used to create the Google Cloud project for the lab, and enter the generated token.

**Step 4**

Enter the project ID for the Google Cloud project created for the lab.

**Don't forget to clean up after yourself**: Delete the project to avoid unnecessary charges. Use `gcloud projects delete <PROJECT-ID>`.
