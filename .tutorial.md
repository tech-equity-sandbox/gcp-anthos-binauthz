## Getting started

Depending on the platform setup, the asset may initialize automatically or may need to be manually executed. To manually execute the asset, run the command `./gcp-anthos-binauth.sh` on the terminal.

When you run the script, it sets up the pre-requisite automation tools behind the scenes. 

Please be patient, and allow a few seconds for the lab to initialize. 

You will be promted to enter any key to continue once the initialization process is complete.

There are 3 modes of operation. 

Change the mode by selecting step `m`, and enter your preference by selecting an option from the list below:

- `y` to preview configuration or commands.
- `n` to execute commands in the create mode.
- `d` to delete resources in the delete mode.

Enter any key to return to the menu, and click the **START** button below.

## Selecting a project

You need to select a project to deploy the resources required for this lab.

*Hint: You should be the Owner or Editor of this project. We recommend deleting the project at the end of the lab to avoid incurring additional costs.*

Change the mode by selecting step `m`, and select the create mode by entering `n` at the prompt.

If prompted for a code, enter a valid code. For help, contact `support@techequity.cloud`.

Click the **NEXT** button to continue.
